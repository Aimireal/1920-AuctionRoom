# University of Huddersfield - Distributed Systems CHS2546
University assignment in order to use a JavaSpace to run an online auction room.

The requirements of the application are as follows:

1) The ability for anyone with access to the system to add a new lot for auction.  This
could simply be a text description of an item for sale.

2) The ability for anyone in the room to scroll through all available lots in the space 
and to recall details of any lot. These details will include a list of
all public bids for the item.

3) The ability for anyone in the room to make a public bid against any item.

4) The ability for anyone in the room to make an offer to “Buy it now”.  This would 
immediately close the auction for the selected lot and 'Sell' the item.

5) The ability for the owner of a lot to withdraw the item from the sale at any time, or 
to accept the current highest bid. The JavaSpace notify function 
should be used to inform the successful bidder that their offer has been accepted.
