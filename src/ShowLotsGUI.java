/*
    ShowLotsGUI - Shows all of the current lots in the space so we can buy from these active ones
    ToDo: Everything needs doing for this. Sort once Purchase and Sell on their own work

    ToDo: To get the UI we can go with Java Swing and use the Take Demo stuff to create a List of Items. We can then add a searchbar to filter the list and buttons to buy and sell to launch the areas we need. Passing ID of lots if required.
